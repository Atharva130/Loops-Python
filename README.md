# Loops in Python

## Introduction
Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met. Python provides `for` and `while` loops for iteration.

## Key Concepts
- Automate repetitive tasks  
- Use with sequences like lists, tuples, strings, etc.  
- Can include control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`  

## Topics to Learn
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- Loop control statements (`break`, `continue`, `pass`)  
- Nested loops  
- Iterating over different data types
